### Adding native functionality to hybrid applications with an Apache Cordova plugin
In some cases, developers of a hybrid MobileFirst application might have to use a specific third-party native library or a device function that is not yet available in Apache Cordova.

With Apache Cordova, developers can create an Apache Cordova plug-in, which means that they create custom native code blocks, and then call these code blocks in their applications by using JavaScript.

This sample demonstrates how to create and integrate a simple Apache Cordova plug-in.
